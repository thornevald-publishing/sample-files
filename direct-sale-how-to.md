# HOW TO SELL DIRECT: THE INDIE AUTHOR MANUAL (2026 UPDATE)

*Last updated: January 02, 2026*  
Use freely. Modify as needed. Good luck.

## 1. THE SITE: WHERE YOU OWN THE AUDIENCE

**Goal:** Your website is no longer a brochure. It’s your **storefront, newsletter hub, and fulfillment command center**.

**Options:**

* **WordPress + WooCommerce** – Classic, battle-tested. Tons of plugins for eBooks, subscriptions, physical books. Pros: full control, huge community. Cons: can be heavy if poorly maintained.
* **Headless CMS:** **Decap CMS** (successor to Netlify CMS) or **Sanity.io**. Pros: modern, lightning-fast, secure, perfect for authors wanting a "Archive & Evidence" aesthetic. Cons: needs someone comfortable with static builds and deployments.
* **Shopify** – Pure commerce. Super smooth for payments, inventory, digital downloads. **Pro tip:** Use the “Shopify Starter” plan ($5/mo) if you just want buy buttons on a static site. Cons: monthly fee, less control over experience.
* **Ghost CMS + Stripe** – Lightweight, author-friendly, great for eBooks, subscriptions, newsletters. Cons: not ideal for large physical inventory.

## 2. HOSTING PARTNERS

Depends on your stack:

* **WordPress/WooCommerce:**

  * Recommended: **Kinsta**, **SiteGround**, **Cloudways**. Managed hosting for speed, security, backups.
* **Static / Headless stack:**

  * Recommended: **Vercel**, **Netlify**, **Cloudflare Pages**. Instant deploys, SSL, CDNs built-in.
* **Domains:**

  * **Squarespace Domains** or **Cloudflare Registrar**. Cloudflare sells at cost and keeps your overhead low.
* **Shopify / Ghost:**

  * SaaS; hosting baked in. Custom domains handled through Squarespace or Cloudflare.

## 3. PAYMENT PROVIDERS

* **Stripe + Apple Pay / Google Pay** – In NZ, these are now the default for online payments, surpassing EFTPOS. Handles cards, A2A (Account-to-Account) payments, and recurring subscriptions globally.
* **POLi** – Still around, but banks have pushed back on security. A2A / Pay by Bank is the emerging method.
* **Shopify Payments** – If using Shopify, easiest route; fees included.

**Rule of thumb:** Stripe + Apple/Google Pay is the backbone. A2A optional. Avoid obscure processors unless your market demands it.

## 4. DIGITAL DELIVERIES

* **BookFunnel** – Handles eBook delivery, email-gated access. Must be connected to your store; it doesn’t process payments itself.
* **Lemon Squeezy** – The 2026 MoR choice. Handles payments, EU VAT, and digital tax automatically. Strong competitor to Gumroad/SendOwl.
* **WooCommerce / Shopify Digital Downloads** – Native solutions if you already run a store.

**Rule of thumb:** Automate file delivery. Manual emailing is unprofessional and eats time.

## 5. PHYSICAL BOOKS

* **Print-on-demand:** **IngramSpark**, **Lulu**, **BookBaby** — global reach, low upfront cost.
* **Direct fulfillment / indie-first:** **Bookvault** — native Shopify/WooCommerce app automates print-and-ship orders. When a reader buys a signed or deluxe copy, it prints and ships automatically. No lifting a finger.

**Shipping / logistics:**

* **NZ Post** – Tracked and courier services; check Jan 2026 rate updates.
* Consider **ShipStation** or **EasyShip** for volume automation.

## 6. EMAIL / MARKETING

* **MailerLite**, **ConvertKit**, **SendFox**, **Klaviyo**.
* Capture emails at checkout — offer bonus chapters, short stories, or PDF extras.
* Segment lists: pre-orders, subscribers, past buyers. Precision beats shotgun every time.

## 7. SEO & DISCOVERABILITY

* Each book gets a dedicated page with proper title/subtitle and schema markup.
* Fresh content (blog/news updates) keeps site alive and Google-friendly.

## 8. TRACKING & ANALYTICS

* **Google Analytics / GA4** – baseline.
* **Plausible Analytics** – lightweight, privacy-focused alternative.
* **WooCommerce / Shopify reports** – track sales, margins, repeat buyers.

## 9. SECURITY

* **Passkeys** – 2026 standard. Use for CMS, Shopify, Stripe. More secure than passwords + 2FA.
* SSL mandatory.
* Backup strategy: daily/weekly snapshots.
* Keep CMS, plugins, themes updated.

## 10. STRATEGY: START SMALL, SCALE FAST

1. Launch one or two books direct first. Test pricing, fulfillment, and email capture.
2. Add physical editions, bundles, or bonus content gradually.
3. Use platforms for discovery while your direct channel grows.
4. Automate everything you can; manual steps = lost money.
5. Iterate using real data, not trends.

**TL;DR:**

* WordPress/WooCommerce = full control, medium effort.
* Decap CMS / Sanity.io = modern headless, dev-needed.
* Shopify = frictionless commerce, less control.
* Stripe + Apple/Google Pay = backbone of payments.
* Bookvault = top direct-fulfillment choice.
* Lemon Squeezy = MoR for digital taxes.
* Email list = your real leverage.
* Automation + Passkeys = sanity + security.
* Platforms = traffic, not leverage.

**Outcome:** Follow this, and you reclaim readers, revenue, and control. Do it sloppy, and you’re just renting space in someone else’s walled garden.
