## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy governs the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated systems within the **[Organization Name]** ecosystem. It applies to all internal staff, third-party technology vendors, and external contributors (authors/freelancers) who utilize AI to generate, recommend, or distribute content.

Our primary objective is to ensure that digital publishing remains a safe environment for all readers, particularly minors, by adhering to "Safety-by-Design" principles.

## 2. Prohibited AI Outputs & Content Standards

All AI systems integrated into our platform must be strictly configured to prevent the generation or surfacing of the following to users under the age of 18:

* **Explicit Material:** Graphic sexual content or AI-generated sexually suggestive imagery.
* **Harmful Instructions:** Content that promotes, instructs, or encourages self-harm, eating disorders, or dangerous physical challenges.
* **Exploitative Content:** Deepfakes or the use of non-consensual imagery.
* **Unvetted Medical/Mental Health Advice:** Automated "companionship" or therapy-simulating bots that provide health advice without human oversight.

## 3. Mandatory Age Assurance (2026 Standards)

In compliance with global "Highly Effective Age Assurance" mandates, **[Organization Name]** and its vendors agree to:

* **Hard Age Gates:** Implement robust verification (e.g., biometric age estimation, credit card verification, or EUDI Wallet tokens) before allowing access to catalogs classified as "Mature" or "Adult."
* **Signal Integration:** For mobile apps, utilize the **Apple PermissionKit (iOS 26.2+)** or **Google Play Age Signals API** to respect system-level parental controls and age categories.
* **Zero-Storage Policy:** Biometric data used for age estimation must be processed locally or by an encrypted third-party; **[Organization Name]** will not store raw biometric images of users.

## 4. Transparency & Forensic Logging

To meet the "Explainability" requirements of the 2026 EU and UK frameworks:

* **AI Labeling:** All content generated primarily by AI (e.g., AI-written blurbs, cover art, or automated newsletters) must be clearly labeled as "AI-Assisted" or "AI-Generated."
* **Forensic Auditing:** Vendors must maintain logs for a minimum of 90 days explaining *why* an AI recommendation engine served specific content to a user, to be made available in the event of a regulatory audit.
* **Prompt Monitoring:** Chatbots must use "negative prompt filtering" to prevent users from bypassing safety guardrails (e.g., jailbreaking).

## 5. Parental Rights & Data Minimization

* **Revocation of Consent:** Our systems must support the immediate "lock-out" of content if a parent or guardian revokes consent via an app store or platform setting.
* **Data Minimization:** We will only collect the minimum amount of age data required to prove compliance. Once a user's age category is verified (e.g., "13-15" or "18+"), the specific underlying document or scan must be deleted.

## 6. Reporting and Incident Response

If an AI system surfaces inappropriate content to a minor:

1. **Immediate Triage:** The content must be flagged and hidden within 60 minutes of the report.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** The vendor must provide a report within 48 hours detailing the "hallucination" or safety failure.
3. **Regulatory Notification:** If required by law (e.g., under the UK OSA), the breach will be reported to the relevant authority (e.g., Ofcom).
