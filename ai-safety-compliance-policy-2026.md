# AI Safety & Compliance Policy 2026: Publisher & Vendor Template

**Notice to Readers:** This template is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. As of January 2026, regulations such as the UK Online Safety Act, the EU Digital Services Act, and various US State "Age Assurance" laws are in active enforcement. Consult with your legal counsel to tailor this document to your specific jurisdiction.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy governs the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated systems within the **[Organization Name]** ecosystem. It applies to all internal staff, third-party technology vendors, and external contributors (authors/freelancers) who utilize AI to generate, recommend, or distribute content.

Our primary objective is to ensure that digital publishing remains a safe environment for all readers, particularly minors, by adhering to "Safety-by-Design" principles.

## 2. Prohibited AI Outputs & Content Standards

All AI systems integrated into our platform must be strictly configured to prevent the generation or surfacing of the following to users under the age of 18:

* **Explicit Material:** Graphic sexual content or AI-generated sexually suggestive imagery.
* **Harmful Instructions:** Content that promotes, instructs, or encourages self-harm, eating disorders, or dangerous physical challenges.
* **Exploitative Content:** Deepfakes or the use of non-consensual imagery.
* **Unvetted Medical/Mental Health Advice:** Automated "companionship" or therapy-simulating bots that provide health advice without human oversight.

## 3. Mandatory Age Assurance (2026 Standards)

In compliance with global "Highly Effective Age Assurance" mandates, **[Organization Name]** and its vendors agree to:

* **Hard Age Gates:** Implement robust verification (e.g., biometric age estimation, credit card verification, or EUDI Wallet tokens) before allowing access to catalogs classified as "Mature" or "Adult."
* **Signal Integration:** For mobile apps, utilize the **Apple PermissionKit (iOS 26.2+)** or **Google Play Age Signals API** to respect system-level parental controls and age categories.
* **Zero-Storage Policy:** Biometric data used for age estimation must be processed locally or by an encrypted third-party; **[Organization Name]** will not store raw biometric images of users.

## 4. Transparency & Forensic Logging

To meet the "Explainability" requirements of the 2026 EU and UK frameworks:

* **AI Labeling:** All content generated primarily by AI (e.g., AI-written blurbs, cover art, or automated newsletters) must be clearly labeled as "AI-Assisted" or "AI-Generated."
* **Forensic Auditing:** Vendors must maintain logs for a minimum of 90 days explaining *why* an AI recommendation engine served specific content to a user, to be made available in the event of a regulatory audit.
* **Prompt Monitoring:** Chatbots must use "negative prompt filtering" to prevent users from bypassing safety guardrails (e.g., jailbreaking).

## 5. Parental Rights & Data Minimization

* **Revocation of Consent:** Our systems must support the immediate "lock-out" of content if a parent or guardian revokes consent via an app store or platform setting.
* **Data Minimization:** We will only collect the minimum amount of age data required to prove compliance. Once a user’s age category is verified (e.g., "13-15" or "18+"), the specific underlying document or scan must be deleted.

## 6. Reporting and Incident Response

If an AI system surfaces inappropriate content to a minor:

1. **Immediate Triage:** The content must be flagged and hidden within 60 minutes of the report.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** The vendor must provide a report within 48 hours detailing the "hallucination" or safety failure.
3. **Regulatory Notification:** If required by law (e.g., under the UK OSA), the breach will be reported to the relevant authority (e.g., Ofcom).

### **Vendor Acknowledgment**

*By integrating with [Organization Name], the Vendor acknowledges they have read and will comply with the AI Safety Standards outlined above as of January 1, 2026.*
